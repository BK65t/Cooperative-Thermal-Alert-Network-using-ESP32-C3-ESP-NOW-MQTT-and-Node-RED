# Cooperative-Thermal-Alert-Network-using-ESP32-C3-ESP-NOW-MQTT-and-Node-RED
The Cooperative Thermal Alert Network (CTAN) uses ESP32-C3, DHT11 sensors, and NeoPixel LEDs to monitor temperature and propagate alerts via ESP-NOW. The gateway aggregates data, forwards it to MQTT, and visualizes it on Node-RED. Nodes operate with a duty cycle of 0.017%, ensuring low power consumption.
